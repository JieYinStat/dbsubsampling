The goal of dbsubsampling is to provides a unified interface for IBOSS, Lowcon, OSS and 
  other popular design-based subsampling methods.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dbsubsampling from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JieYinStat/dbsubsampling")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to get subsample index, such as uniform sampling and OSMAC:

```{r example}
library(dbsubsampling)

data <- data_binary_class
# Uniform sampling
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data, n = 10, method = "Unif", seed_1 = 123)
# OSMAC-A
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data, n = 10, pilot_n = 100,
  method = "OSMAC_A", seed_1 = 123, seed_2 = 456)
# OSMAC-L
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data, n = 10, pilot_n = 100,
  method = "OSMAC_L", seed_1 = 123, seed_2 = 456)
```

You can get more detailed examples from the article column on the [website](jieyinstat.github.io/dbsubsampling/).
