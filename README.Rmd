Providing a unified interface for IBOSS, Lowcon, OSS and other popular design-based subsampling methods.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dbsubsampling from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JieYinStat/dbsubsampling")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to get subsample index, such as uniform sampling, OSMAC, IBOSS, Leverage, OSS, LowCon, IES and DDS:

```{r example}
library(dbsubsampling)

data_binary <- data_binary_class
data_numeric <- data_numeric_regression

# Uniform sampling
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data_binary, n = 10, method = "Unif", seed = 123)

# OSMAC-A
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data_binary, n = 10, pilot_n = 100, method = "OSMAC_A", 
            seed_1 = 123, seed_2 = 456)

# OSMAC-L
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data_binary, n = 10, pilot_n = 100, method = "OSMAC_L",
            seed_1 = 123, seed_2 = 456)

# IBOSS
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data_numeric, n = 100, method = "IBOSS")

# Leverage
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data_numeric, n = 10, method = "Leverage", replace = TRUE, 
            seed = 123, shrinkage = 0.9)

# OSS
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data_numeric, n = 30, method = "OSS")

# LowCon
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data_numeric, n = 10, method = "LowCon", seed = 123, theta = 1)

# IES
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data_numeric, n = 10, method = "IES", seed = 123, q = 16)

# DDS
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data_numeric, n = 10, method = "DDS", ratio = 0.85)
```
