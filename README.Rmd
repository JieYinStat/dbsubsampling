Providing a unified interface for IBOSS, Lowcon, OSS and other popular design-based subsampling methods.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dbsubsampling from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JieYinStat/dbsubsampling")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to get subsample index, such as uniform sampling, OSMAC, IBOSS and
OSS:

```{r example}
library(dbsubsampling)

data_binary <- data_binary_class

# Uniform sampling
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data_binary, n = 10, method = "Unif", seed_1 = 123)

# OSMAC-A
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data_binary, n = 10, pilot_n = 100, method = "OSMAC_A", 
            seed_1 = 123, seed_2 = 456)

# OSMAC-L
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data_binary, n = 10, pilot_n = 100, method = "OSMAC_L",
            seed_1 = 123, seed_2 = 456)

# IBOSS
data_numeric <- data_numeric_regression
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data_numeric, n = 100, method = "IBOSS")

# OSS
subsampling(y_name = "y", data = data_numeric, n = 30, method = "OSS")
```

You can get more detailed examples from the article column on the [website](https://jieyinstat.github.io/dbsubsampling/).
