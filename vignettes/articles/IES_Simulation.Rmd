```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(dbsubsampling)
library(parallel)
```

I'll write a small snippet of code here to check if it works on the github remote server. Mainly because `mclapply` doesn't run on windows, in addition to testing to see if parallel computation is possible and estimating the runtime.

```{r}
data <- data_IES_Case_1_Train
start_time <- Sys.time()
result <- mclapply(1:10000, function(x) lm(y ~. , data = data)[["coefficients"]][1], mc.cores = 5)
print(Sys.time() -  start_time)
```
